This folder is created so that we can keep our configurations in the classpath of the spring cloud
config server.

Here we have kept all the configurations of the microservices from all the environments.
In our base yml file of the microservices, we will just define which is the active profile and
the url of the configuration server, to read the activated profile's yml.

Once the microservice is up, it will hit the url where config server is running and will search
for the active profile yml in the classpath of the config server, once found it will inject the
desired values based on the active profile

Inside the yml file of the configServer, we have to specify what is the search location

If we want to read the configuration from an external file then just remove all the yml from here and
keep it inside a folder in your machine, then inside the application yml of the configServer define the
below property
  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        native:
          search-locations: "file:///C://Users//rakes//Downloads//configProperties"
