This folder is created so that we can keep our configurations in the classpath of the spring cloud
config server.

Here we have kept all the configurations of the microservices from all the environments.
In our base yml file of the microservices, we will just define which is the active profile and
the url of the configuration server, to read the activated profile's yml.

Once the microservice is up, it will hit the url where config server is running and will search
for the active profile yml in the classpath of the config server, once found it will inject the
desired values based on the active profile
