  #    This tells springboot where is our config server located,
  #  When we do some configuration changes in github while our services are running, then to reflect those changes
  #  we have to enable actuator endpoints in the service and hit one specific endpoint called refresh
  #  eg:- http://localhost:9000/actuator/refresh is the endpoint for this service
  config:
    import: "optional:configserver:http://localhost:8071/"

#This will enable all the endpoints given by the actuator
